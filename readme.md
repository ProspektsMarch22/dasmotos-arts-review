# Dasmoto's Arts & Craft

## A Codecademy HTML and CSS Project

In this review project, i implement some basic HTML and CSS to create a static, one-page website for an art supplies company.

The goal was to be able to do it in less than **20 minutes**.

I've made it!

I'm also using this repo for git/github review purposes.
